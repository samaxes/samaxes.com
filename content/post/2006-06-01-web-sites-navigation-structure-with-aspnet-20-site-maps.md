A Web site should present visitors with a simple yet flexible navigation structure so that they can travel to various parts of the site easily.
ASP.NET 2.0 provides a feature called SiteMap that helps you implement this functionality.

[This article](http://www.codeguru.com/csharp/.net/net_asp/webforms/article.php/c12015) explains what site maps are and describes how to develop Web site navigation structures that use them.
