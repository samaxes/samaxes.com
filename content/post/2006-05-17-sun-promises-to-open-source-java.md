[Sun Microsystems](http://www.sun.com/) is planning to release the source code of the Java programming language, chief executive [Jonathan Schwartz](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/media/ceo/mgt_schwartz.html) said at the [JavaOne](http://www.sun.com/javaone) conference in San Francisco.

> It's not a question of whether we'll open source Java, the question is how

Schwartz told delegates in his opening keynote at the tradeshow.
