Now that almost everyone has heard about [HTML 5](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/), maybe not all of you know what's new for us developers.

[Lachlan Hunt](http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/speakers/#lachlan) and [James Graham](http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/speakers/#jamesg) have presented on 2008-05-29 at [@media 2008](http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/) in London [Getting Your Hands Dirty with HTML5](http://lachy.id.au/slides/hands-on-html5/hands-on-html5.pdf).
I really find it a great presentation and a good start if you want to check what's new with the new HTML/XHTML version.

Lachlan Hunt is also the editor of [The Web Developer's Guide to HTML 5](http://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/). Any suggestions can be added to the [wiki](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/wiki/).
We are all welcome to contribute, so let's get our hands dirty!
