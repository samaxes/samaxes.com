You probably have already heard about [Yousif Al Saif's Multiple IE installer](http://tredosoft.com/Multiple_IE) which makes possible to run Internet Explorer 6 in standalone mode. The problem is that Multiple IE doesn't work on Microsoft Vista (still you can use an [Internet Explorer Application Compatibility VPC Image](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70868)).

Hopefully Yousif Al Saif is making progresses in [getting Internet Explorer 6 run natively under Windows Vista](http://tredosoft.com/IE6_For_Vista_Part_1).

More news to come...
