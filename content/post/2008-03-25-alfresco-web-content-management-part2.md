I've had a lot of feedback with my article [Exactly what is Alfresco?]({{< ref "post/2006-05-24-exactly-what-is-alfresco.md" >}}). A recurrent question I've received was where to find more info about WCM with Alfresco.

You can [Download Alfresco Web Content Management 2.1](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alfresco/files/%5BArchive%5D/%5BArchive%5D%20WCM/Alfresco%202.1/) under [Download Alfresco Community Network](http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Download_Alfresco_Community_Network). There you can find [Alfresco 2.1 Web Content Management Product Evaluation Guide](http://sourceforge.net/projects/alfresco/files/%5BArchive%5D/%5BArchive%5D%20WCM/Alfresco%202.1/WCM2_1-Product-Evaluation-Guide.pdf/download) which is a very complete guide about the WCM module.

Hope this helps.
