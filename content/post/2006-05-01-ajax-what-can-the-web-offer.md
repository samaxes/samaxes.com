[Max Kiesler](http://www.maxkiesler.com/) has posted on his site, a listing of 50 different Ajax toolkits and frameworks, and a listing of 30 different AJAX Tutorials.

1. [Round-up of 50 AJAX Toolkits and Frameworks](http://www.maxkiesler.com/2006/04/12/round-up-of-50-ajax-toolkits-and-frameworks/)
2. [Round-up of 30 AJAX Tutorials](http://www.maxkiesler.com/2006/03/15/round-up-of-30-ajax-tutorials/)

Of course, the lists are by no means complete, but they do include not only the "big names" but also several of the smaller, lighter libraries the web has to offer.
