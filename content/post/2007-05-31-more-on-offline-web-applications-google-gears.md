[Google](http://www.google.com/) announced [Google Gears](http://gears.google.com/) at [Google Developer Day 2007](http://code.google.com/events/developerday/).

Google Gears is an open source browser plugin that will enable developers to create offline web applications using JavaScript APIs. As a developer, you'll be able to make an application with the assurance that it will work offline and online across browsers.

[Google Reader](http://reader.google.com/) is the first online application to offer "Gears-enabled offline capabilities". After you load the Gears plugin you get a new icon at the top of your Reader window which enables offline capabilities of Google Reader.

The great news about Google Gears is that [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/) and Google are working together; [Dojo Offline](http://o.dojotoolkit.org/offline) has been ported to use Google Gears as the base platform.

[Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/) has interviewed Brad Neuberg from Dojo Offline, [listen to the podcast](http://media.ajaxian.com/podcasts/audibleajax-show-21.mp3).
