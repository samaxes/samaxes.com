Alongside with the IE6/IE7 Application Compatibility VPC Images (VPC Hard Disk Image for testing websites on IE on Windows XP SP2), Microsoft now provides an [IE8 version](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=70868).

This is a great way to test your web applications since the [IE8 Beta1 installation](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/ie8/readiness/Install.htm) overwrites the previous IEs present in your system.
