[Tribix](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tribix/) 2.1.0 final - Extended emitters for [BIRT (Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools)](http://www.eclipse.org/birt/) provides a set of extended emitters for BIRT 2.1.0 final or above.

It comes along with a PPT (MS PowerPoint) emitter preview release. You can now export all your reports made with the BIRT Reporting System to Excel, or even preview them in PowerPoint.

This version does support fixed-column-width sheet output and image export to Excel which are great news since [my last post about Reporting Tools]({{< ref "post/2006-04-19-xlsms-excel-emitter-for-birt.md" >}}).

Here's a screenshoot:
