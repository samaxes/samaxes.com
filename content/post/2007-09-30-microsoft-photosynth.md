Some great graphics technologies are emerging lately.

One that looks very promising is [Photosynth](http://photosynth.net/) from Microsoft Live Labs.

> Photosynth takes a large collection of photos of a place or an object, analyzes them for similarities, and then displays the photos in a reconstructed three-dimensional space, showing you how each one relates to the next.

Earlier this year, [Blaise Aguera y Arcas](http://www.ted.com/speakers/blaise_aguera_y_arcas.html) had demonstrated [Seadragon](http://www.seadragon.com/) and [Photosynth](http://photosynth.net/) at the TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) Conference in Monterey.
