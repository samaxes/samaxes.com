Today I stumbled on an [article from 5ThirtyOne](http://5thirtyone.com/archives/589) about an IE7 JavaScript library simply called [IE7](http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/).

> IE7 is a JavaScript library to make IE behave like a standards-compliant browser. It fixes many CSS issues and makes transparent PNG work correctly under IE5 and IE6

Impressive...
