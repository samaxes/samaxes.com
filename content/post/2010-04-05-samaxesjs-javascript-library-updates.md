Both the TOC (Table of Contents) components from [samaxesJS JavaScript library](http://code.google.com/p/samaxesjs/) have been updated.

Changes include:

* Reduced file size by removing duplicated code using a for loop when defining and processing indexes (1.8KB for the minified jQuery TOC plugin).
* Added a new option: `context`, allowing the TOC to list headings from only a portion of the page.

Please report any bug you may find in the project [Issue Tracking](http://code.google.com/p/samaxesjs/issues/list).
