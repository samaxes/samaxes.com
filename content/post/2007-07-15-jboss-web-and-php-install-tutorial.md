Approximately 2 years ago I've written a set of [PHP Tutorials](http://www.php-tutorials.info/) that served as a guideline for a Beginner's PHP Training Course. These tutorials were made with the WAMP solution stack in mind.

Since I've been working with Java EE Technologies and Servers recently, I've decided do add another one explaining [how to install JBoss Web 1.0.1 GA with PHP support](http://www.php-tutorials.info/installJBossWeb.php) (PHP Handler Servlet).

This was based on a [tutorial by Philippe Fievet](http://www.fievet.biz/jbossweb-install/) that is now offline for some reason.
