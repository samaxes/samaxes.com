Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript, give a keynote at [The Ajax Experience](http://ajaxexperience.com/).

[Ajaxian](http://ajaxian.com/) have placed [the presentation online](http://ajaxian.com/archives/brendan-eich-javascript-2-and-the-future-of-the-web) so everyone can read up on some of the thoughts and discussion on JavaScript 2 and more.

Here we got to hear from the mouth of someone deep into the ECMA process about what we are going to see in JavaScript 2 and importantly why:

> **Motivation for JS2**
>
> * Fix problems in JS1 that bug people daily
> * A type system to enforce invariants
>   * instead of writing/debugging lots of value-checking code
>   * optional annotations, an extension to JS1
> * Programming in the large
>   * Package system
>   * Visibility qualifiers (namespaces, private internal public)
>   * Optional static type checking
> * Support bootstrapping and metaprogramming
>   * Self-host most of the standard objects
>   * Self-host compiler front end and type checker
>   * Reduce need for future ECMA Editions
>
> As Brendan flicked through these slides, I couldn't help buy realise how important the decisions are. These changes are probably going to profoundly effect all of our lives in the near future.
