I've recently implemented some new improvements to [Minify Maven Plugin](https://github.com/samaxes/minify-maven-plugin).

Version 1.6 added support for [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) and version 1.7 offers several performance improvements and more detailed logs (e.g. compression benefits from minification).

A complete list of changes can be found in the [changelog file](https://github.com/samaxes/minify-maven-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

For next releases I'm planning to add [Source Maps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/) support and improve the documentation.
