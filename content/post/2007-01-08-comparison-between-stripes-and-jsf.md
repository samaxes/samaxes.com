Reading the [TheServerSide.COM](http://www.theserverside.com/) news I've found a comparison's article between [Stripes](http://www.stripesframework.org/) and [JSF](http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/) frameworks.

I can't agree more with the author Gregg Bolinger when he says Since I stumbled on Stripes, I've found it to be the best all around framework for my purposes.

Read it at "[Stripes and JSF: A Brief Comparison](http://radio.javaranch.com/gthought/2007/01/03/1167862566323.html)".
