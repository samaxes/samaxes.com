I've already commented in a [previous post]({{< ref "post/2006-05-17-google-web-toolkit-ajax-applications-in-java.md" >}}) about the [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/). The Google Web Toolkit was the talk of JavaOne 2006, offering developers a way to create Ajax applications by writing Java and having the toolkit generate the client-side JavaScript, which can call back to Java servlets through an RPC-like call.

Robert Cooper offers an [initial tutorial](http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2006/05/31/working-with-google-web-toolkit.html) to get you up and running with GWT.
