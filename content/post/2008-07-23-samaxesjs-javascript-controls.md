samaxesJS is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript, for building rich interactive web applications.

The first extension is a dynamic Table of Contents script.

The TOC control dynamically builds a table of contents from the headings in a document and prepends legal-style section numbers to each of the headings:

* adds numeration in front of all headings,
* generates an HTML table of contents,
* degrades gracefully if JavaScript is not available/enabled.
