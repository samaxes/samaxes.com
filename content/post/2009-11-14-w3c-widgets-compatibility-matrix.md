Daniel Silva, [Marcos Caceres](http://datadriven.com.au/) and myself have completed Phase 1 of [Widget Packaging and Configuration](http://www.w3.org/TR/widgets/) compatibility testing. We have also detailed the results as part of the conformance matrix.

We would like to publish the results as a working group note. Phase 2 will begin in about 3 weeks, in which we are hoping to start working with vendors to improve overall conformance.

We need help with Phase 2: if you know a team contact for any of the targeted products that are claiming conformance to W3C Widgets, then would appreciate your help in making them aware of the results of the testing - [Implementation Report: Widgets Packaging and Configuration](http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets/imp-report/).
