A while back (May 24th) I've written a [post trying to explain what was Alfresco]({{< ref "post/2006-05-24-exactly-what-is-alfresco.md" >}}), and some misunderstands about it.

At that time Alfresco wasn't yet a full Web Content Management system. But that is about to change starting at [Release 1.4](http://dev.alfresco.com/downloads/).

I think it may worth the shoot...
