**Coding conventions** are rules that computer programmers follow to ensure that their source code is easy to read and maintain.

## Why is that important?

Sun Microsystems provides the following rationale for the Java Programming Language:

> Code conventions are important to programmers for a number of reasons:
>
> * 80% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance.
> * Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author.
> * Code conventions improve the readability of the software, allowing engineers to understand new code more quickly and thoroughly.
> * If you ship your source code as a product, you need to make sure it is as well packaged and clean as any other product you create.

Crossbow Software has gather a set of code conventions and programming style documents, take a look at their [Coding Style Standards download page](http://www.textrush.com/coding-standard.htm).
