I'm really impressed about Microsoft responding to their customers and to the community.

> ## Microsoft Expands Support for Web Standards
>
> Company outlines new approach to make standards-based rendering the default mode in Internet Explorer 8, will work with Web designers and content developers to help with standards behavior transition.

&nbsp;

> ## Microsoft's Interoperability Principles and IE8
>
> We've decided that IE8 will, by default, interpret web content in the most standards compliant way it can. This decision is a change from what we've posted previously.
> Microsoft recently published a set of [Interoperability Principles](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/presskits/interoperability/default.mspx). Thinking about IE8's behavior with these principles in mind, interpreting web content in the most standards compliant way possible is a better thing to do.

That's awesome. An unified industry can move forward.
