[Spring-RCP](http://spring-rich-c.sourceforge.net/)'s mission is to provide an elegant way to build highly-configurable, GUI-standards-following rich-client applications faster by leveraging the Spring Framework, and a rich library of UI factories and support classes. It only has a 0.1.0 release available, but might be worth watching.
