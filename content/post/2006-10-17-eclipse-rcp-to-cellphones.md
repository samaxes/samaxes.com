Great news for embedded devices developers.
Eclipse has recently released the embedded Rich Client Platform ([eRCP](http://www.eclipse.org/ercp/)) 1.0.

eRCP is for J2ME what RCP is for the desktop, and includes among other things

* Eclipse Core which provides **OSGI** and Extension Point Framework support
* a version of SWT called embedded Standard Widget Toolkit (**eSWT**)
* **eJFace** a set of classes which enable eRCP applications to integrate with an eRCP workbench, and provide more complex widgets like MVC oriented viewers
* eUpdate for dynamically updating device software
* and **microXML** a smaller, faster XML parser supporting SAX and DOM API

eRCP currently support Windows Mobile 2003/5.0, Symbian S60/S80, and QT embedded devices.
