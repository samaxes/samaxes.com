Alexander Netkachev has a nice set of articles in his [site](http://www.alexatnet.com/) about [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com/) (MVC-based framework written in PHP) and its features, how to integrate it with others frameworks like [PRADO](http://www.pradosoft.com/) (component-based and event-driven framework written in PHP5) or [Dojo library](http://dojotoolkit.org/) (Javascript/AJAX toolkit), and more.

Have a look at [Alex @ Net](http://www.alexatnet.com/blog/2/categories/zend+framework).
