The Java EE 5 specification ([JSR 244](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=244)) has passed its [final approval ballot](http://jcp.org//en/jsr/results?id=3770) unanimously. This means the specifications under it - JSF 1.2, JSP 2.1, EJB 3.0, JAX-WS, and other specifications - are all set to go, even if the implementations aren't ready for prime time. This clears the way for implementations to solidify compliance, and also providing a stable target for programmers to use in development.
