Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's ASP.NET and Atlas development guru, has posted a two-part article on using the Language Integrated Query, or [LINQ](http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/ref/linq/), within ASP.NET projects.

* [Part 1](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/05/14/Using-LINQ-with-ASP.NET-_2800_Part-1_2900_.aspx) how to create the ASP.NET page using LINQ, using rich collections of strings, refactoring collections, working with .NET Standard Query Operations and using Anonymous types.
* [Part 2](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/06/04/Using-DLINQ-with-ASP.NET-_2800_Part-2-of-my-LINQ-series_2900_.aspx) details about DLINQ, or LINQ for databases, such as creating a DLINQ-enabled object model, hierarchical binding and basic pagination.

And more is on the way:

> In my next few LINQ posts I'll show how we will be able to build on top of the concepts I demonstrated above to easily add sorting, in-line editing, deleting, and selection support over our customer data â€“ and also show how to easily Ajax enable it with Atlas.
