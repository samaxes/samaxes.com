Struts is by far the most common web framework, but it is by no means the only option.
[Java Server Faces](https://javaserverfaces.java.net/) has made a splash lately, but there are a number of open source alternatives, including [Spring MVC](http://www.springframework.org/), [WebWork](http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/), [Tapestry](http://tapestry.apache.org/), and [Cocoon](http://cocoon.apache.org/).

I've found two interesting presentations that survey these available web frameworks, taking a look at what kind of code and content you need to write for each, specific strengths or weaknesses, and how to select the best web framework for your unique application requirements.

* [Comparing Web Frameworks: Struts, Spring MVC, WebWork, Tapestry & JSF](https://equinox.java.net/framework-comparison/WebFrameworks.pdf) by Matt Raible
* [Comparing Web Frameworks](http://chariotsolutions.com/slides/pdfs/osconf2005-webframeworks.pdf) by Brian McCallister, Greg Hinkle, Erin Mulder

The second one takes even a closer look at how do these web frameworks work.
